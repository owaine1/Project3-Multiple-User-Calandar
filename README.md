# Multiple user calandar app

Technologies used:
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Passport.js
* Mongodb

TODO this needs development with the database. Intention was that each user (there are 5 users) creates slots and these are then stored in the database. All users apart from admin have the rights to just read / show other users'  slots used. i.e. if a slot is taken, pick another slot. The admin has the right to see what slots have been used and to delete, create and update any of these.
TODO just needs more work!
