This app is Project 3.
Current thoughts are a music style app.  Likely with a number of users (small amount) that users can login to.
Mandatory
Number of users login.
Using Node: Express & Passport
IDEAS
Maybe a simple 'to do' list.
share and exchange ideas and update and delete comments(?).
Maybe a found or scouting music / ideas.
A small voting system?
Sounds a bit like a mini Facebook??? NOOOOOO...
Maybe timed in a way that has deadlines, if user doen't interract, then their vote is not used or passed to someone-else.
Incentivisation
I'm thinking on 'living in a shared house' rights. Maybe could even be for kids / siblings. Could even be in confinement, e.g. prison, old peoples homes, etc., etc..
Locigal thoughts are what music can be played next in a shared space environment. Maybe alocate slots. Think even no music. So booking slots of time. Exactly like a calandar? So calandar rather than a todo list???
Then have 2 or 3 databases?
1 users
    bill
    bob
    betty
    brian
    barbara
1 playlists / songs
1 calandar with comments???
Comments could include a group proxy for a player/user not to play THAT most annoying song, or limit to one play.
Would be great if it could be hooked up to Spotify as to stop a person from playing one type of song or genre or artist, though beyond scope of this project and quite complex. This then also has the addition of reducing priviliges/rights.
Extra feature, again beyond scope is to add stats of most plays/least plays.
Forfiture of right to play for some other rights, e.g. this privilige could be used as currency.
Main view is the calandar. 
So a table
days - as evenings 6-11pm
weekend as 9am to 12pm
DB as mongo could just be 2 dbs. Users and all the other stuff just added into fields as they are generated.
What are the fields for the big database???

Need to link-up calandar to database, same database as Mongodb is fine, maybe different collection, but would still need to link users to calandar, so same collection?
Mongodb needs to show calandar availability, write data etc. i.e. the CRUD
These fields seem to be mon, tue, wed, thur, fri, sat1, sat2, sun1, sun2, certainly which pertain to the user and is more frontend / UX oriented i.e. JQuery.
But probably need specific field for each slot of time. (interestingly, while I'd stick with Mongodb, this does feel more mySQL based. Senario could call for using Mongo & mySQL)

will need to check that slot is not already taken.
fields: 
mon6, mon7, mon8, mon9, mon10, mon11,
tue6, tue7, tue8, tue9, tue10, tue11,
wed6, wed7, wed8, wed9, wed10, wed11,
thur6, thur7, thur8, thur9, thur10, thur11,
fri6, fri7, fri8, fri9, fri10, fri11,

sat9morn, sat11morn, sat1aft, sat3aft, sat5aft, sat7aft, sat9aft, sat11aft
sun9morn, sun11morn, sun1aft, sun3aft, sun5aft, sun7aft, sun9aft, sun11aft

above should be some variable, even a function or 2 as a variable
i.e. find (mongo command)

finding and allowing
mongo { slot: /^mon/ }

jquery as an include file...??? Doesn't work as is.
